HVX
===
Disciplined Convex Programming and Symbolic Subdifferentiation in Haskell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a snapshot of the HVX package that is compatible with GHC version
7.6.3, which is included with Haskell Platform version 2013.2.0.0.  If you
would like the most recent version of HVX, please see (TODO), which has the
most recent version of the code, but unfortunately requires GHC version 7.8.2.

To install HVX:
 - Install the Haskell Platform: http://www.haskell.org/platform/
 - Install your operating system's LAPACK and GSL packages
 - ./install.sh (no sudo needed)

See examples/example.hs for an example of how to use this code.

Run the example with:
ghci examples/example.hs
